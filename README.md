A Machine learning approach to correcting wind and wave forecasts using recent forecasts and observations.

Preliminary testing is done on National Buoy Data Center (NDBC, [link](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)) wind and wave buoys in combination with Wave Watch 3 wave hindcasts (WW3, CFSR Phase 2, [link](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/hindcasts/))

Datasets were wrangled and preprocessed and available upon request (they several GBs)
